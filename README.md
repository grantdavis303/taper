# Taper

An educational health and wellness web application that allows users to track their alcoholic unit consumption by entering in values for a drinkâ€™s ounces and alcohol-by-volume (ABV) percentage.

### Local Setup

1. Navigate to Repo

```
cd taper
```

2. Install Dependencies

bundle install
```

3. Create a New Database

```

```

### How It Works

Users first create an account and then login to the application, where they will see three different pages:

* The **Dashboard** Page - A page that lists the total alcoholic units and total drink count consumed for today, the current week, the current year, as well as all-time. Additionally, there is a weekly breakdown section where each week lists the units and drink count consumed from that particular week.

* The **New Drink** Page - A page that allows a user to enter a new drink to track by entering a drink's ounces and alcohol-by-volume (ABV) percentage.

* The **All Drinks** Page - A page that lists all of a user's logged drinks.
