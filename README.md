# Taper

### [Live Deployment](https://taper-4affd5dec44c.herokuapp.com/)

### About

Taper is a web application designed to track a user's alcohol consumption.

### How It Works

Users first create an account and then login to the application, where they will see three different pages:

* The Dashboard Page - A page that lists the total alcoholic units and total drink count consumed for today, the current week, the current year, as well as all-time. Additionally, there is a weekly breakdown section where each week lists the units and drink count consumed from that particular week.

* The New Drink Page - A page that allows a user to enter a new drink to track by entering a drink's ounces and alcohol-by-volume (ABV) percentage.

* The All Drinks Page - A page that lists all of a user's logged drinks.

### Versions

- Ruby 3.2.2
- Rails 7.1.3.4
