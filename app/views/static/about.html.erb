  <h2> What is this app? </h2>
  <p> This app allows users to track what they drink by entering in values for a drink's ounces and alcohol-by-volume (ABV) percentage. </p>

  <h2> Who is this app for? </h2>
  <p> This app is for everyone! This app is for anyone that is curious what they drink on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. </p>

  <h2> How do I use this app? </h2>
  <p> 
    After creating an account, login to the application and add a new drink by clicking the "New Drink" link at the top of the page.
      <br><br>
    Then, select the type of drink you would like to add (beer, wine, spirit, or seltzer currently), and enter the drink's ounces and alcohol-by-volume (ABV) percentage. For example, a light beer would be "12" for ounces and "4.4" for percentage.
      <br><br>
    Finally, click "Add Drink." This will then add the drink to the "All Drinks" page, as well as populate the data fields on the main dashboard.
