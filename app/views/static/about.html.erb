  <h2> What is this app? </h2>
  <p> This app allows a user to track and monitor their alcohol consumption by logging each drink by entering in values for the drink's ounces and alcohol-by-volume (ABV) percentage. </p>

  <h2> Who is this app for? </h2>
  <p> This app is for anyone truthfully. This app is for anyone that wants to monitor their alcohol consumption with the goal of eventually drinking nothing (being sober), anyone that wants to limit their drinking to just a few times per week, or anyone that just wants a place to log what they drink and have the information stored in one place. </p>

  <h2> How do I use this app? </h2>
  <p> 
    After creating an account, login to the application and add a drink by clicking the "New Drink" link at the top of the page. 
      <br><br> 
    Then, select the type of drink you would like to add (beer, wine, spirit, seltzer) and enter the drink's ounces and alcohol-by-volume (ABV) percentage. For example, a light beer would be "12" for ounces and "4.2" for percentage. 
      <br><br> 
    Finally, click "Add Drink". This will then add the drink to the "All Drinks" page, as well as populate the data fields on the main dashboard for today, this week, this month, and this year.
